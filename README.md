# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief overview of the tech stack used:

- This project uses the [React web development framework](https://react.dev/). React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. The component-based approach has been used for this **literal** single page app to display all relevant info.
- Instead of CRA as the build tool, this project uses ["Vite.js"](https://vitejs.dev/), due to it's efficiencies in compiling and bundling code.
- For styling, this project uses ["TailwindCSS"](https://tailwindcss.com/). The aim of this project is to create a media kit, but to also practice Tailwind as it's application in projects is gaining prominence. 
- My media kit uses the font ["DM Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) and ["Montserrat"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) as its main font.

# What is mazzilio?

Alongside my day to day of being an engineer, I like to create accessible content on TikTok to discuss my own journey into tech and to help those also considering this journey. My focus has been on accessible pathways, comparisons of stacks and frameworks, and project ideas for beginners (and a lot of other topics!).

The aim of this media kit is to provide an overview for any organisations on the type of work I do and the content I create. It is also intended as an opportunity for me to practice using Vite and TailwindCSS whilst creating something I might find useful in the future!


# ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing
Interested in contributing to my media kit? I really appreciate the thought but for now, this media kit is complete for it's intended usage. 

If you would like to contribute feedback, improvements or make your own version - this code is available for you to clone and use for your own projects and developments.

# üåü Spread the word!
If you want to say thank you and/or support active development of my Media Kit:
- Add a GitHub Star to mazzilio's media kit!
- Connect with me and let me know what improvements or feedback I can make. :)

Thanks so much for your interest in growing the reach of the Well app!

## Want to run it locally?
Feel free to download and use this code for your own portfolios and examples of a Tailwind & React Project. To run the project you simply have to run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
This piece of work has not been unit tested as of now, but code coverage and unit tests will be addressed once an opportunity arises for me to focus on it.
